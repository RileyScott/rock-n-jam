          <ul>
            <div class=img2 id="harness"></div>
            <li>Harness. A good harness should be comfortable, and fit around your hips and legs snugly. Make sure you get the right size, because nylon climbing equipment is usually not returnable!</li>
            <div class=img2 id="belay"></div>
            <li>Belay Device. This is what allows the person on the ground to feed you slack, or stop you from falling! Options range from the simple to the complex, and prices range from $10 to over $100.</li>
            <div class=img2 id="rope"></div>
            <li>Rope. It's been said you can never have too much rope, but you can certainly have too lilttle. Your rope should be more than twice the distance you plan on climbing.</li>
            <div class=img2 id="shoes"></div>
            <li>Shoes. These should fit tighter than your everyday shoes! They're made to stretch out and fit your feet. The style of toe and arch depend on how aggressively you want to climb.</li>

            <li>Chalk.</li>
